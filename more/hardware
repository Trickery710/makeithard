Log to RAM to save SD card writes

Typical inexpensive SD cards have a limited number of writes available. The solution to this is to prolong the life by writing to memory and periodically writing the data back to disk.

In order to do this with minimal configuration, there is an excellent little tool called zram-config which makes the whole process painless. Installation and documentation can be found on at this git repository: https://github.com/ecdye/zram-config.
